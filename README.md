# Art-Gallery-Database

Group 14: Huy Nguyen, Janit Kumar, Rina Ryu

The domain we will be modelling is an art gallery. The database will primarily consist of information regarding art pieces of many forms (paint, sculpture, digital, etc.).

Each art piece will contain specific information such as; the artist, title, type of art, location, and date created. The database will allow users to easily view, sort, and search for art and its specifications.

There will be two types of users accessing the database, regular everyday users, and curators. Regular users will only be able to view and search through the database. 

They will also be able to save/bookmark certain artworks. Curators will have all the same capabilities as regular users and in addition they will also be able to add new art pieces to the database.
